# PyTorch RNN-based Q&A System

This repository contains a simple Question Answering (Q&A) system built using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with PyTorch. It demonstrates how to encode questions and decode answers using basic sequence-to-sequence learning.

## 🚀 Features

- Encoder-Decoder RNN architecture
- Built with PyTorch
- Custom vocabulary creation and tokenization
- Training from Q&A pairs
- Interactive question answering

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Encoder RNN**: Encodes the input question into a context vector.
- **Decoder RNN**: Decodes the context vector to generate the answer.
- **Loss Function**: Cross Entropy Loss
- **Optimizer**: Adam

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core programming language for implementation
- **PyTorch** – Deep learning framework for building and training the RNN model
- **NumPy** – For numerical operations and array handling
- **Google Colab** – Cloud-based environment used for development and training

## 📥 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Satishnaidu2633/Pytorch-RNN-based-Q-A-System
cd Pytorch-RNN-based-Q_A-system

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

- 🔁 **Upgrade to LSTM or GRU**: Replace the basic RNN with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models to better handle long-term dependencies in sequences.

- 🎯 **Attention Mechanism**: Integrate an attention mechanism to allow the decoder to focus on specific parts of the input sequence, improving answer quality.

- 🧠 **Pre-trained Embeddings**: Use pre-trained word embeddings such as GloVe or Word2Vec for more meaningful word representations.

- 📚 **Larger Datasets**: Expand training using real-world datasets like SQuAD, Natural Questions, or other domain-specific corpora to improve robustness.

- 🌐 **Web Interface**: Build a user-friendly interface using Flask, Gradio, or Streamlit for interactive usage.

- 💾 **Model Saving and Loading**: Add support for saving and reloading trained models to avoid retraining from scratch.

- 📊 **Evaluation Metrics**: Incorporate metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, or F1-score to quantitatively evaluate model performance.

- 🛠️ **Beam Search Decoding**: Implement beam search during decoding to improve the fluency and relevance of generated answers.
